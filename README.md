🌱 Crop Diseases & Pests Detection & Recommendation System

This project is a machine learning–based system designed to detect crop diseases and pest infestations affecting major cereal crops such as maize, wheat, rice, and sorghum. It supports both image-based detection (using leaf photos) and tabular data analysis (symptoms, environmental factors, etc.). After identifying a disease or pest, the system provides clear, practical recommendations based on standard agricultural practices.

🔍 Overview

The system analyzes either uploaded leaf images or manually entered farm data and predicts the most likely disease or pest affecting the crop. It then provides prevention and management recommendations to help farmers reduce losses and improve productivity.

✨ Features

Detection of common diseases and pests affecting cereal crops

Support for both image input and tabular symptom data

Machine learning model for prediction

Automated recommendation engine for prevention and control

Visualization of trends and patterns (EDA)

🧠 Technologies Used

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

TensorFlow or PyTorch (for image models)

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Streamlit or Flask for a simple interface

🚀 How It Works

User uploads a leaf image or enters the crop symptoms.

The system preprocesses the input and sends it to a trained ML model.

The model predicts the likely disease or pest.

The engine generates recommendations on prevention, field management, and monitoring.

📊 Current Focus

Cereal crops (maize, wheat, rice, sorghum)

Common fungal diseases, bacterial infections, and major pest attacks

Simple ML models (Decision Trees, CNN for images)

📌 Future Improvements

Mobile application version

Real-time detection using a live camera

Integration with weather-based disease forecasting

Support for more crop varieties and larger datasets
